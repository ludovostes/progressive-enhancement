    <h4><i>The story</i></h4>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br> 
        They said,<q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong><br>
        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <br>
        <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events.You now have eight horses! You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong>
    </p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.<br>
        The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong> The next day the conscription officers came around<br>
        to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<br>
        <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong>
    </p>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens
        in it is good or bad<br> 
        — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, 
        you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

    <p>Conclusion<br>
        Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
